## Project Overview
The project builds a predictive model for mental health outcomes, specifically targeting the likelihood of depression, using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to analyze mental health survey data to provide accurate predictions, utilizing advanced machine learning models such as XGBoost. The data is preprocessed, analyzed, and optimized using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters, ensuring robust and reliable predictions. Visualizations with Seaborn provide deeper insights into the data, aiding in understanding the factors that influence mental health.

## Features of the Dataset:
   - Demographic Information: Age, gender, and educational background of participants.
   - Mental Health Indicators: Survey responses related to academic pressure, job satisfaction, and financial stress.
   - Behavioral Data: Sleep duration, dietary habits, and work/study hours.
